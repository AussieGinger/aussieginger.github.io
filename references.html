    <h2>Thanks and Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
        I want to extend my thanks to every single member of Cassinia and all of the teams that go into it. 
        This is the most positive work environment I have ever been a part of and it is thanks to every single person in the company. 
        A special thanks to a few people. 
        Tilly, for teaching me the wise ways of fencing and generally putting up with me in the field. 
        Ray for showing me so much and answering all of my (i imagine very very tedious) questions. 
        Rick for always engaging me with riveting deep conversations, and introducing me to the best Vanilla slice in Australia. 
        Laura and John VT for their education on plant Identification. 
        Josie and Kim for helping make me feel comfortable and heard as an Intern, and a person. 
        And anyone else I have worked with and generally interacted with for being welcoming and kind to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I thought I would summarise some of the other skills that I learned as well, as I did learn and absorb alot.
        I leared some very basic fencing principles.
        I learned alot about keeping livestock, like worm levels and maintaining hooves.
        I learnt alot of plant identification, both on how to identify plants and learning different thisles, weeds and plants.
        I learnt about erosion and revegitation.
        I learnt alot about pest control and the effects of pests on the environment.
        I also learned a number of miscelaneous skills. 
    </p>
