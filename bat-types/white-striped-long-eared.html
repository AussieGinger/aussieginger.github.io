            <p>Chocolate Wattled Bats were observed in moderate numbers on the Victorian Bio-Diversity Atlas &#40A total of 11 were observed&#41.</p>
            <p>They were observed in a number of habitats: Lake Bed Vegitation, Black Box Vegitation, River Red Gum Forest Vegitation, Chenopod &#40Saltbush&#41 Shrubland. As well as a combination of these vegitations.</p>
            <h2 class = "bat-text-subheading">Bat Information</h2>
            <p>The Chocolate Wattled Bat was also observed in the area in an earlier survey conducted in 1994.</p>
            <p>Chocolat wattled bats roos in hollows of old trees mostly, however they also roost in disused birds' nests. They have also been observed roosting in/on structures &#40Houses ect.&#41. As well as caves in the nullabor region.</p>
            <p>The Chocolate Wattled Bat feeds on small moths and insects</p>
            <p>Chocolate Wattled Bats are vulnerable to loss of roost sites in tree hollows as well as feeding grounds due to forestry activities. Clearing for agriculture and housing also pose a risk.</p>
