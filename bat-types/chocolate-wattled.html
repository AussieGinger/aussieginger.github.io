            <p class="mx-2">Chocolate Wattled Bats were observed in moderate numbers on the Victorian Bio-Diversity Atlas &#40A total of 11 were observed&#41.</p>
            <p class="mx-2">They were observed in a number of habitats: Lake Bed Vegitation, Black Box Vegitation, River Red Gum Forest Vegitation and Chenopod &#40Saltbush&#41 Shrubland. As well as a combination of these vegitations.</p>
            <p class="mx-2">The Chocolate Wattled Bat was also observed in the area in an earlier survey conducted in 1994.</p>

                <li>Chocolate wattled bats roosts in hollows of old trees mostly, however they also roost in disused birds' nests and have been observed roosting in/on structures &#40Houses ect.&#41. As well as caves in the nullabor region.</li>
                <li>They roost in colonies of 20 - Hundreds of bats.</li>
                <li>The Chocolate Wattled Bat feeds on small moths and insects</li>
                <li>Chocolate Wattled Bats are vulnerable to loss of roost sites in tree hollows as well as feeding grounds due to forestry activities. Clearing for agriculture and housing also pose a risk.</li>
