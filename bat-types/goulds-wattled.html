                <p class="mx-2 text-lg text-center">Gould's Wattled Bats were observed in high numbers on the Victorian Bio-Diversity Atlas &#40A total of 38 were observed&#41. <br>
                They were observed in a number of habitats: Black Box Vegitation, Lignum Vegitation, River Red Gum Forest Vegitation and Chenopod &#40Saltbush&#41 Shrubland. As well as a combination of these vegitations. <br>
                The Gould's Wattled Bat was also observed in the area in an earlier survey conducted in 1994.</p>

                <li>Gould's wattled bats roosts in hollows of old trees mostly, they also roost in ceilings or basements of buildings. They have also been observed roosting in lighter shrubery. A typical colony size is around 30 bats. </li>
                <li>The Gould's Wattled Bat feeds on a variety of insects. This can include: Scarab Beetles, Caterpillars, Crickets as well as Moths. This depends on the time of year.</li>
                <li>Gould's Wattled Bats are vulnerable to loss of roost sites in tree hollows as well as feeding grounds due to forestry activities. Clearing for agriculture and housing also pose a risk.</li>
