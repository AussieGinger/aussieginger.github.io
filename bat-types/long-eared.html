            <p>Gould's Long Eared Bats were observed in low numbers on the Victorian Bio-Diversity Atlas &#40A total of 6 were observed&#41.</p>
            <p>They were observed in a number of habitats: Lake Bed Vegitation, Black Box Vegitation, River Red Gum Forest Vegitation, Chenopod &#40Saltbush&#41 Shrubland and Lignum Vegitation. As well as a combination of these vegitations.</p>
            <h2 class = "bat-text-subheading">Bat Information</h2>
            <p>Gould's Long Eared Bats roosts in hollows of old eucalypts mostly, however they also roost in buildings and can sometimes be found under the bark of trees and in dissused birds nests. Generally colonies are comprised of around 25 females. Males generally roost alone.</p>
            <p>The Gould's Long Eared Bat feeds on small flying insects however can also snatch non-flying insects off the ground or leaves. It also hybernates dirong winter for up to 11 days.</p>
            <p>Gould's Long Eared Bats are vulnerable to loss of roost sites in tree hollows as well as feeding grounds due to forestry activities. Clearing for agriculture and housing also pose a risk.</p>
