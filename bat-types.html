                <p>The lake powell site is located close to the Murray River. <br> It backs onto a small offshoot of the murray river named Bonyaricall Creek. <br> The site is located roughly 20km South East of Robinvale or 110km South east of Mildura.</p>
                <p class= "">Trust for nature had informed casinia that they believed there was a chance that there was bats at the Lake Powell Site before the property was purchased.</p>

                <h2 class = "text-3xl font-semibold text-center my-2 ">How I Researched</h2>
                <p>The Victorian Biodiversity Atlas is linked <a class = "font-semibold hover:font-normal" href = "https://vba.biodiversity.vic.gov.au/vba/#/">here</a></p>
                <p>
                    To begin I isolated an area around the site, and filtered my search down to bats. <br> 
                    From there I was displayed a number of species and sightings. They were Seperated into two main observations. <br>
                    One group of observations from 1994 and another from 2013.<br>
                    I did not use the 1994 survey as evidence of the bats being there as I deemed it less reliable and too long ago to be relevant. <br> 
                    However if a species of bat was observed during both 2013 and 1994 then I simply noted that as an increased likelihood.<br>
                    So in addition I looked on the Australian museum website in order to work out the prevelance of bats in the area.<br>
                    This assisted in crosschecking to ensure that specific bat species were present in the area.
                    The data from the 2013 study also listed numbers of bats observed as well as the vegetation the bats were observed in.<br>
                    I ended up narrowing the species down to 4 likely suspects. The Chocolate wattled bat, Goulds: Wattled, and long eared bats as well as the White Striped Freetailed Bat.<br>
