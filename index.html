    <h2>Who am I and why did I do a website.</h2>
    <p>
    I am Joshua Burns, hi. I am currently studying a bachelor of Computer Science at Swinburne University, majoring in Cyber Security
    I thought I would do a website instead of just a powerpoint as, well, the ammount of times I said something along the lines of 
    "I am studying computer science, I know it doesn't neccesarily relate to environment ect." So I thought I would show how my computer science studies
    can in fact assist me with environmental work.

    </p>

<h2>Backstory for the Project</h2>
<p>I was told basically "There might be bats, noone has even looked into this, you would be going in blind</p>
<p>I initially wasn't going to do it. However I went on a trip to vanuatu and went into a cave filled with bats, and, well, was pretty struck by what a cool animal they are.</p>

<h2>Approaching the Project</h2>
<p>At first it was pretty daunting, But I decided to break it up into a few different things along the way to keep me on track</p>
<list>
    <ol>
        <li><a href = "bat-types.html">Identifying Possible Species</a> &#40Click It!&#41</li>

            <li>Based on Location</li>
            <li>Based on Previous Research &#40See Image 3&#41 </li>
            <li>Where those Species reside</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Monitoring Methods</li>
