                    <p class = "mx-1.5">Hi. I'm Joshua Burns</p>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5">I am currently studying a bachelor of Computer Science at Swinburne University, majoring in Cyber Security.</p>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5">I thought I would do a website instead of just a powerpoint because I would often find myself saying something along the lines of:</p>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5 italic">"I am studying computer science, I know it doesn't neccesarily relate to environment ect."</p>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5">So I thought I would show how my computer science studies can in fact assist me with environmental work.</p>
                <h3 class = "text-center text-3xl font-semibold my-1.5">Backstory for the Project</h3>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5">I was told something along the lines of:</p>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5 italic">"There might be bats, noone has even looked into this, you would be going in blind"</p>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5">Initially I wasn't going to do this project. However I had a change of heart when I went on a trip to Vanuatu. I went into a cave filled with bats, and, well, was pretty struck by what a cool animal they are. Unfortunately I don't have a photo of the cave or bats within the cave, however, the noises of the bats rushing past me was surreal.</p>
                <h3 class = "font-semibold text-center text-3xl my-1.5">Approaching the Project</h3>
                    <p class = "mx-1.5">At first it was a very daunting prospect, But I decided to break it up into a few different things along the way to keep me on track:</p>
