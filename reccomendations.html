                Knox and I went up to Lake Powell with the Bat Detector that I had Identified would be an affordable and realistic option. <br>
                Whilst performing other tasks and duties I observed places on the property that I thought may have been good places to set up with the detector. <br>
                The main place I had identified before going to the site physically had been the creekbed as there would be large trees, which would increase the roost likelyhood. <br>
                Whilst there I also Identified 1 other place that could potentially house them however it was on the other side of the property from the river, and as such I did not think it would be a good idea to attempt observations there. <br>
                I also spoke with the tenant (Roc) and he claimed there was also a bat population on the property, he directed us towards a couple of trees that he believed they were roosting in, we did not observe any in that location.

                Knox and I set out to the property as sunset was approaching and headed to the creek, however it was flooded, which limited how close we could get to the larger trees. <br>
                Another issue was that for some reason the detector was giving alot of static noise off which meant that had there been bats it would have been extremely hard to hear. <br>
                I attempted to tinker with the detector in the field and unfortunately damaged it. This meant we were relying purely on our observational skills. <br>
                Unfortunately we did not see any bats that night, nor did I see any physical evidence of bats during our time doing other tasks at the property. <br>
                This was a very dissapointing resutl however I do believe in researching bats, roosting tendancies and detection methods, I believe I have assisted in having bat monitoring techniques in the future. <br>
                For example, if a more premium bat detector was purchased, when someone is out at night doing tasks, they could bring the detector with them and set it up in the location, and see if any bats are observed whilst doing another task. <br>

    <h2>Reccomendations</h2>
    <p>
        If bat observation is attempted in the future, I would reccomend a passive bat detector, as it would allow for a much more reliable and accurate observation. 
        It would also allow for the detector to be left for an extended period of time without needing any additional trips to the site. 
        However if a passive bat detector is not available, I would reccomend a more reliable active bat detector, as the one I had purchased was not very reliable and was not very useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        From my research I noted <a href = "https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/products/echo-meter-touch-2-android-2">THIS </a>
        detector as a good option, however it is a active detector and requires a newer android phone to run. (this could be overcome by purchasing a cheaper $80 phone that is specifically kept with the device to store recordings)
        Whilst it does not have a Bat ID feature for Australia yet. It does allow visualisation and recording of the calls, which would allow for the calls to be sent to someone who could potentially identify the calls. 
        The detector would also be updated with Australian Bat ID software when it is released.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I would also reccomend bringing a spotlight in order to boost visibility irregardless of the bat detector used.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would not reccomend using traps of any kind as they are very very invasive. 
        As we do not need to measure the individual bats, or test them, they are ultimately not the best used case for the type of monitoring that cassinia would be interested in.
        They also require the obtaining of multiple permits that would be tedious to obtain.
